# LLM demo

This is a simple demo project showing that I know how to use LLM :)
The RAG contains contents from the [LDS website](https://ldsociety.ca/)

## Tech stack

### Frontend

NextJS + React

### Backend

Django + LangChain

### LLM

localhost Ollama

### DB

chromaDB as RAG (PostgresDB is a great alternative that has vector db extension, but chromaDB is better for a quick and dirty demo)
